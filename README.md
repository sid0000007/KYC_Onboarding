This is a **multi-step progress form** project built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to fill in details such as name, date of birth, dropdown options, and upload files. The project enhances the user experience with a visually appealing progress bar and step completion tracker. The backend uses **Turso (SQLite)**, **Drizzle ORM**, and **TypeScript** within a monorepo setup.
